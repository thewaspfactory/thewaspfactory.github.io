        <h5>The Hurt Creature, A Conversation with <br>
          Ben Frost and Prof. Dr. Reinhard Haller</h5>

        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">How rare are instances of children who commit murder?</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">They are actually extremely rare especially in the way they are depicted in the novel where a child murders more than one person. However, the story does feature a whole range of psychological and psychodynamic material that would be typical for the development of a serial killer. This is the story of an autistic person. His mother has abandoned the family, his father has withdrawn because he is insane and Frank lives in a fashion we would associate with autism. In his teenage years he will probably develop borderline autism disorder.</p>

        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">There is a grey area when it comes to the diagnosis of autism. There is no obvious physical manifestation as with Down’s syndrome, it's something quite abstract, it's ... it's at least somewhat subjective.</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">Yes. But what's important here is the psychopathological aspect: An autistic person is someone who withdraws completely into his own world. In the novel this is symbolized by the closed off island that Frank defends against the outside, where he assumes the role of absolute dictator. He doesn't allow anyone else in.</p>

        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">It's not so much the differences in the way Frank interacts with his world that I find most shocking, it's actually in the ways he is very similar to me and my experience of childhood. I remember very vividly believing I was at war with the natural world – homemade explosives, weapons fashioned out of tree branches, lighting fires, elaborate fantasy, slingshots, blowing up mailboxes... There was this place in the back garden of my grandmother's house where my brother and I would put our bicycle helmets on and go to war with these territorial gulls that lived out the back- armed with hand made spears and bows and arrows, covered head to toe in filth. When I read this book for the first time there were so many aspects of the way in which Frank interacted with his world that I really connected with personally...</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">At the core of The Wasp Factory are aspects, which could be interpreted on a deeper psychological level and other aspects, which could be understood on a symbolic or archaic level. There are several cases of schizophrenia or delusions in Frank’s family, paranoia so to speak. Frank shows the same risk factors that are common in most serial killers.</p>

        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">Yes, exactly, and that is my point, I am not a serial killer. My family is not without its- shall we say- “unique characters”, and both my parents were very high ranking police officers- both entangled in the investigation of some very serious crimes, often involving homicides and some very dark sexual abuse cases- I was inadvertently exposed to some very inappropriate shit as a kid - so where is that line? And what stops someone like me from crossing that line?</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">This is the key question, for which we still don't have an answer. There are approximately four hundred known cases of serial killers worldwide and there are one hundred twenty that still haven't been caught yet. We can't say for sure what made them do it exactly. What we do know are the risk factors: the missing mother, an uncaring upbringing, the burden of mental disorders and the behavioural disorders which occur in childhood such as torturing animals, arson, running away from home. And another important factor is a syndrome, which is characteristic in serial killers: malignant narcissism as described by the New York psychoanalyst Otto Kernberg. He said that this is a personality disorder which is shared by all serial killers. This is certainly true for all the cases which I have analysed. They are sadists, meaning they obtain sexual pleasure by torturing others. As children they torture animals, like Frank does. This in an indication for severe sadism: obtaining sexual pleasure through the torture of other human beings. That's the first element described by Banks in the novel.</p>

        <p class="haller">The second is the absolute lack of empathy: the autistic aspect. The third is the desire to exercise power over others, the wish to dominate, to decide someone’s faith, to decide whether a person lives or dies. That's why Frank has created his own special world.</p>

        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">Frank justifies all of these acts. He recognizes that killing a six-year-old innocent girl is not a good thing, but he justifies it through the belief system that he created. The Wasp Factory is his religion.</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">Yes, I would also interpret it that way. Frank was a typical autist as a child; the secluded island is clear indicator for that. But later on he developed something typical in autism: borderline personality disorder. And that is a central theme in the novel: Is Frank still normal or has he gone insane, is he already schizophrenic?</p>

        <p class="haller">Frank’s half brother Eric is a symbol for the illness, the insanity, which is bound to get to Frank. Eric escapes from the mental institution and that is hanging in the air throughout the story. Then Eric arrives on the scene with a loud bang and that symbolically articulates the decisive moment: whether Frank will actually become insane or get a grip on things.</p>

        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">It’s interesting to me that you read Eric as a symbol. When I first read the book, I assumed
        that Eric was not a real person, that he is just this kind of manifestation. There is one crucial line in the book where I think Banks gives that idea away to the reader- Eric is on the phone to Frank and says “nobody has to sleep, I never sleep now, that way I can keep watch and make sure they don ́t creep on you”. The use of you as opposed to me changes everything.</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">Yes, I agree. Eric symbolizes the looming insanity.</p>


        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">How often do you come across a case, where these characteristics are entangled in issues of sexual identity or gender?</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">In reality this is a rare phenomenon. Among the 400 cases I have studied there were maybe two or three cases in which the gender issue you mentioned was relevant.</p>

        <p class="haller">In terms of a deeper psychological interpretation the story is one of finding one's identity. In that way it's similar to Richard Wagner's Parsifal. Now Frank is, genetically speaking, a woman. And despite having been castrated chemically, at the core he remains a woman. He tried to compensate for his lost genitalia by using weapons, setting up traps, building fuel bombs, by attacking people with slingshots.</p>

        <p class="haller">I think this story is about a person who has not found his identity, symbolized by the wrong gender - About a person who has to find his way through this psychoanalytical maze full of sadism, cruelties and negative fantasies. He himself calls his acts, the torturing of animals, the murders, as a phase in his development. He says that he will never kill another human again.</p>

        <p class="haller">The malignant narcissist, the serial killer, is paranoid. He is extremely distrustful which is why he meticulously plans his actions and tries to safeguard himself - just like Frank does by patrolling the island. This is what makes him so hard to catch. He doesn’t act on impulse and doesn’t make mistakes, but rather thinks everything through, plans very thoroughly, like a spy in a foreign city who expects every one to be an enemy. That's what makes him so dangerous. BF: The whole trajectory of human evolution is to move further and further away from our animal self, from something that is connected to the earth, to nature, which is somehow brutal and uncaring and without empathy. Is the future without murder?</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">On a global level we can actually see a decline in the number of murders committed annually. For example, sex killings involving children have become very rare, only 1% as compared to the number of cases in 1950.</p>

        <small class="ben">Ben Frost:</small>
        <p class="ben">But the nature of the crimes has changed?</p>

        <small>Prof. Dr. Haller:</small>
        <p class="haller">The modern murderer is no longer the sadist, the sexually abnormal being nor the psychopath. Today it is the hurt creature. Humans are very easily hurt, emotionally, a fact we tend to overlook. To be “cool”, meaning to be without emotion appears to be a contemporary trend. But in reality we humans are extremely vulnerable. If we take serial killers or “school shooters” as an example, we know that the main risk factor is a feeling of exclusion. These people feel that they're not being taken seriously, or are not respected. And then for one moment they want to be important: they will show the world what they've got. They want the big “net” to hold its breath for a moment. They want to claim their fifteen minutes of fame.</p>
